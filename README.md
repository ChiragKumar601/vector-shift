Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

Open another terminal or command prompt and navigate to the frontend directory of your project.
Install Node.js Dependencies:

Run npm install to install all necessary Node.js dependencies specified in your package.json file for the React frontend.
Start the React Development Server:

Run npm start to start the React development server. This command will compile your React code and open your default web browser to view the frontend application. The development server typically runs on http://localhost:3000.
Verify Frontend is Running:

Once the server starts, verify that the frontend is running correctly by accessing http://localhost:3000 in a web browser. You should see your React application interface.




Navigate to Your Backend Directory:

Open another terminal or command prompt and navigate to the backend directory of your project.
Run the FastAPI Application:

Use uvicorn to run your FastAPI application. The basic syntax is:
uvicorn main:app --reload

Replace main with the filename of your Python script (main.py in this case).
Replace app with the name of your FastAPI application instance (app by default in FastAPI).
Example command assuming your main.py file contains an instance of FastAPI named app:

uvicorn main:app --reload

Access the FastAPI Application:

Once the server starts, you can access your FastAPI application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000 (or another port if specified differently).
